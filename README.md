<h1>PerfScroll</h1>
<p>Many of the different scrollbar libraries that I have tried either offer very poor performance or affect the layout
of the site by wrapping the content in a &lt;div&gt; causing issues with CSS selectors.  I needed a simple solution that
provided a scrollbar on the Y-axis and performed well, so I made PerfScroll.  This is currently a work in progress.</p>
